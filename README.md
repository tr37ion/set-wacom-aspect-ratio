# Description

This script sets Wacom tablet's aspect ratio right with different screen setups. It uses Xrandr to determine the current setup.

## Limitations

The current version works best when all screens have the same resolutions. With different screens you may better map the Wacom tablet to one device. It works, but it may work odd depending on how *strange* your setup is. 

# Origin

This script is a fork of Quackmatic's nice **Mapwacom script** from https://gist.github.com/Quackmatic/6c19fe907945d735c045
